PDF Encryptor - Setup Instructions
==============================

1. Install Python
------------------
Download and install Python from the official Python website:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/

During installation, make sure to:
âœ” Check the option "Add Python to PATH"

2. Verify Python Installation
------------------------------
Open a terminal (CMD or PowerShell) and run:

    python --version

or if that doesn't work:

    py --version

You should see something like:
    Python 3.x.x

3. Install pip (Python's package manager)
------------------------------------------
pip is included with most Python installations.

To check if pip is available, run:

    pip --version

If it's missing, see:
    https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

4. Install Required Python Library
-----------------------------------
Install the library required by the script:

    pip install PyPDF2

Or (if using py instead of python):

    py -m pip install PyPDF2

5. Using the Script
--------------------
1. Place the script in a folder along with the `.pdf` files you want to encrypt.

2. Double click the script (or run from terminal):

    python PDF_ENCRYPT.py

3. All encrypted PDFs will be saved in a subfolder called `encrypted`.

    Default password: 1234

You can modify the password by editing the script:
- Find the line: `password = "1234"`
- Replace `"1234"` with your desired password.

6. Optional: Create a Windows Executable (.exe)
------------------------------------------------
To run the program without opening a terminal:

1. Install PyInstaller:

    pip install pyinstaller

2. Compile the script:

    python -m PyInstaller --onefile --noconsole PDF_ENCRYPT.py

3. The `.exe` will be located inside the `dist/` folder.

4. Place it in a folder with `.pdf` files and double-click to run.
   Encrypted files will appear in the `encrypted/` folder.
