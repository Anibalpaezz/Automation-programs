PDF Merger - Setup Instructions
==============================

1. Install Python
------------------
Download and install Python from the official website:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/

Make sure to:
âœ” Check the box "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

2. Verify Python Installation
------------------------------
Open your terminal (CMD or PowerShell) and run:

    python --version

If that fails, try:

    py --version

You should see something like:
    Python 3.x.x

3. Install pip (Python's package manager)
------------------------------------------
pip is included by default in most modern Python installations.

To check if pip is installed:

    pip --version

If not, refer to the official guide:
    https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

4. Install Required Python Libraries
-------------------------------------
Install the required library for this script:

    pip install PyPDF2

Or, if pip is not recognized:

    py -m pip install PyPDF2

5. Run the Script
------------------
Place the script in a folder that contains the PDF files you want to merge.

Then execute:

    python your_script_name.py

This will merge all `.pdf` files in the current folder into one.
The merged file will be saved in a subfolder called `merged`.

6. Optional: Create a Windows Executable (.exe)
------------------------------------------------
To run the program with a double click (no terminal):

First install PyInstaller:

    pip install pyinstaller

Then compile the script into an executable:

    pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole your_script_name.py

The `.exe` file will be generated inside the `dist/` folder.

You can then move the `.exe` anywhere and place your `.pdf` files next to it.
