PDF to DOCX Converter - Setup
==============================

1. Install Python
------------------
Download and install Python from the official website if you don't already have it:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

Make sure to:
âœ” Check the box "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

2. Verify Python Installation
------------------------------
Open your terminal (CMD or PowerShell) and run:

    python --version

You should see something like:
    Python 3.x.x

If that fails, try:
    py --version

3. Install pip (Python's package manager)
------------------------------------------
pip is included by default in most modern Python installations.

Check if pip is available by running:

    pip --version

If it is not found, follow the official guide to install it:
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

4. Install Required Python Libraries
-------------------------------------
Install the only required library for the script:

    pip install pdf2docx

You can also use the following if 'pip' doesn't work:

    py -m pip install pdf2docx

5. Run the Script
------------------
Place the PDF files you want to convert in the same folder as the script.

Then, run the script:

    python PDF_DOCX.py

The converted .docx files will be saved in a 'converted' folder.

6. Optional: Create a Windows Executable (.exe)
------------------------------------------------
If you want to run the program by double-clicking, install PyInstaller:

    pip install pyinstaller

Then generate the executable:

    pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole PDF_DOCX.py

Your executable will appear in the 'dist' folder. Move it where needed.
